Linear Regression
========================================================

To undertand a homogenized work-flow towards statisitcal analysis of data, I will follow the 
book Applied Predictive Modeling. The book uses a running example, that of chemical solubility to illustrate how R can be used to apply various statistical models. We will follow these examples.

In order to really understand a statisical model, I have realized that I have to develop a feeling for
the data. The book tries to do this, using some exploratory analysis in the first three chapters, but 
just reading and running the code printed in the book doesn't help. Instead, I could write down the methods to be used, and rough hints about the R functions that the book mentions, and then try to do my own analysis. The exploratory part will give me some insights about the methods and the data as well, but for the moment I will skip it. Besides, it should sit in a different file. Here I will begin with linear regression.
